# Interface to the shutter and intensifier electronics

The original ASC control box uses good ol' TTL logic circuits with decoders and monostable multivibrators to control relays
that switch the power on/off for the image intensifier and the solenoid that controls the mechanical shutter. Note that
the control electronics comprise a light sensor that prevents opening the shutter and powering the intensifier if the ambient
light levels are too high. 

There is a simple watchdog functionality that switches the intensifier off and closes the shutter if there is no regular signal
from the computer. Previously, the signal from the PC was generated by using a general purpose I/O (and timer/counter?) card.
That card is not compatible with more modern computers and an alternative solution was needed.

The new implementation uses an inexpensive microcontroller board that connects to the PC via USB. The software will then use
a USB-serial port to toggle an output pin i.e. to "pet the watchdog".
